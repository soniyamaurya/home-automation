# Home Automation System

# **PROJECT TITLE: Home Automation System**
My project “Home Automation System” comes under the domain of Internet of Things.
The idea of a smart home is getting attention for the last few years. 
The key challenges in a smart home are intelligent decision making, secure identification, and authentication of the IoT devices, continuous connectivity, data security, and privacy issues. 
The main aim of this project is used to implement Intrusion Detection System (IDS) on Main Door and to implement Smart Light, Smart Fan, Smart Door in the kitchen and even an automatic fish feeder.  It is also ensured that the hardware and technology used in the proposed idea are cheap, easily available, and replicable.


# **OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT:**
To assure home automation continues in a normal fashion, it is necessary to check all important parameters that may complicate the system.
So, the objective of this project is to implement IDS at the main door.
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a piece of hardware and software that identifies and mitigates threats and attacks on your network or on your area.
So, the basic aim of implementing IDS is that no one enters inside without having correct password, there will be buzzer installed which will buzz if the user attempts to open the door with entering incorrect password thrice. The system will go into complete lockdown.
The proposed solution also tries to implement home automation features like a smart light, smart door, smart fan, as shown below:

It also has an automatic fish feeder.


# SCOPE OF PROJECT:
### **The scope of the project is as follows:**
#### **1. IDS:**
This project will contain an Intrusion Detection System which will be there at the main gate the user needs to Enter the Password to open the Door.
If the Password is Correct the Door will Open but, if the Password is Wrong the user will be prompted to enter the password again. If the user tries to enter the wrong password the system will get block.
The whole Process will be displayed on 16*2 LCD.
#### **2. SMART DOOR:**
This Door will be implemented in the Kitchen, where it automatically opens the door for the person standing in the range of 40cm or less than 40cm.
If that person moves beyond the specified range the door will be closed Automatically.
This process of closing and opening on door will be shown on LCD 16x2 display, with the help of micro servo and ultrasonic distance sensor which will be used for measuring the range.
#### **3. SMART LIGHT:**
This smart light will be implemented in hall as soon as it detects any motion the light will turn on.
The status of light turning on and off will be displayed on LCD.
This will be done through the PIR Sensor.
#### **4. SMART FAN:**
The hall will contain automatic fan that will be based on detecting temperature and changing the speed of the fan.
The external temperature will be detected through temperature sensor and the motion of the fan will be represented DC motor.
The temperature will be shown on the console.
#### **5. AUTOMATIC FISH FEEDER:**
A motor will be attached to the feeder and after certain interval the bottle cap will open and food will automatically fall.
